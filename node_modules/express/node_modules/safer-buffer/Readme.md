Modern Buffer API polyfill without footguns, working on Node.js from 0.8 to current.

## How to use?

First, port all `Buffer()` and `new Buffer()` calls to `Buffer.alloc()` and `Buffer.from()` API.

Then, to achieve compatibility with outdated Node.js versions (`<4.5.0` and 5.x `<5.9.0`), use
`const Buffer = require('safer-buffer').Buffer` in all files where you make calls to the new
Buffer API. _Use `var` instead of `const` if you need that for your Node.js version range support._

Also, see the
[porting Buffer](https://github.com/ChALkeR/safer-buffer/blob/master/Porting-Buffer.md) guide.

## Do I need it?

Hopefully, not — dropping support for outdated Node.js versions should be fine nowdays, and that
is the recommended path forward. You _do_ need to port to the `Buffer.alloc()` and `Buffer.from()`
though.

See the [porting guide](https://github.com/ChALkeR/safer-buffer/blob/master/Porting-Buffer.md)
for a better description.

## Why not [safe-buffer](https://npmjs.com/safe-buffer)?

_In short: while `safe-buffer` serves as a polyfill for the new API, it allows old API usage and
itself contains footguns._

`safe-buffer` could be used safely to get the new API while still keeping support for older
Node.js versions (like this module), but while analyzing ecosystem usage of the old Buffer API
I found out that `safe-buffer` is itself causing problems in some cases.

For example, consider the following snippet:

```console
$ cat example.unsafe.js
console.log(Buffer(20))
$ ./node-v6.13.0-linux-x64/bin/node example.unsafe.js
<Buffer 0a 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 28 13 de 02 00 00 00 00 05 00 00 00>
$ standard example.unsafe.js
standard: Use JavaScript Standard Style (https://standardjs.com)
  /home/chalker/repo/safer-buffer/example.unsafe.js:2:13: 'Buffer()' was deprecated since v6. Use 'Buffer.alloc()' or 'Buffer.from()' (use 'https://www.npmjs.com/package/safe-buffer' for '<4.5.0') instead.
```

This is allocates and writes to console an uninitialized chunk of memory.
[standard](https://www.npmjs.com/package/standard) linter (among others) catch that and warn people
to avoid using unsafe API.

Let's now throw in `safe-buffer`!

```console
$ cat example.safe-buffer.js
const Buffer = require('safe-buffer').Buffer
console.log(Buffer(20))
$ standard example.safe-buffer.js
$ ./node-v6.13.0-linux-x64/bin/node example.safe-buffer.js
<Buffer 08 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 28 58 01 82 fe 7f 00 00 00 00 00 00>
```

See the problem? Adding in `safe-buffer` _magically removes the lint warning_, but the behavior
remains identiсal to what we had before, and when launched on Node.js 6.x LTS — this dumps out
chunks of uninitialized memory.
_And this code will still emit runtime warnings on Node.js 10.x and above._

That was done by design. I first considered changing `safe-buffer`, prohibiting old API usage or
emitting warnings on it, but that significantly diverges from `safe-buffer` design. After some
discussion, it was decided to move my approach into a separate package, and _this is that separate
package_.

This footgun is not imaginary — I observed top-downloaded packages doing that kind of thing,
«fixing» the lint warning by blindly including `safe-buffer` without any actual changes.

Also in some cases, even if the API _was_ migrated to use of safe Buffer API — a random p
